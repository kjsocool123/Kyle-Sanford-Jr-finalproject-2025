         <td><h3>Is NIL creating an uneven playing field between big and small schools?</h3></td>
         <td>Yes, NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) deals are creating an uneven playing field between big and small schools. Larger schools with more resources, bigger fan bases, and stronger alumni networks can offer athletes more lucrative NIL opportunities, which helps them attract top talent. In contrast, smaller schools often struggle to compete because they can't match those financial incentives or marketing exposure. This growing gap can make it harder for less wealthy programs to stay competitive, leading to a shift in college sports where success becomes more tied to money than talent development or tradition.</td>

         <td>NIL deals can affect team chemistry and locker room dynamics by creating tension or jealousy among players. When some athletes earn large sums of money or gain more attention through endorsements, it can lead to feelings of inequality or distraction within the team. This can cause rifts, especially if players believe their contributions on the field are not being recognized equally off the field. Additionally, the pressure to build a personal brand might shift focus away from team goals, leading to conflicts or reduced unity. Coaches now have to manage not just athletic performance but also the challenges that come with individual business ventures.</td>

         <td><h3>How NIL is changing the financial landscape of college football.</h3></td>
         <td>NIL is significantly changing the financial landscape of college football by introducing a new stream of income directly tied to athletes’ marketability. Players can now earn money through endorsements, sponsorships, social media, and personal appearances, turning college football into a more commercialized environment. This shift has led to the rise of collectives—groups that pool money to attract top recruits—which blurs the line between amateur and professional sports. As a result, recruiting has become more financially driven, and schools are investing more in marketing, branding, and donor engagement to stay competitive. This evolution is reshaping how programs operate, shifting power and influence toward the athletes themselves.</td>

        <td><h3>Are players choosing schools based on NIL opportunities through the portal?</h3></td>
         <td>Yes, many players are now choosing schools based on NIL opportunities, especially through the transfer portal. With the ability to transfer more freely, athletes are seeking programs that not only offer playing time and exposure but also the best financial incentives through NIL deals. This trend has made the transfer portal a marketplace, where schools with strong NIL backing can attract top talent quickly. As a result, recruiting has become less about tradition or coaching and more about who can offer the best overall package, including endorsement potential, business connections, and media visibility. This shift is changing how teams are built and maintained year to year.</td>

         <td><h3>What is the transfer portal?</h3></td>
         <td>The transfer portal is an NCAA system that allows college athletes to explore opportunities to transfer to other schools. When a player enters the portal, they are officially declaring their intent to leave their current program, and coaches from other schools are allowed to contact and recruit them. Recent rule changes have made it easier for athletes to transfer without having to sit out a season, which has increased the number of players using the portal. It gives athletes more freedom to find better fits for their athletic, academic, or financial goals—especially as NIL opportunities become a major factor in those decisions.</td>

         <td><h3>Is it good?</h3></td>
         <td>The transfer portal can be seen as both good and challenging, depending on the perspective. On the positive side, it gives athletes more control over their careers, allowing them to leave situations that aren’t working—whether due to lack of playing time, coaching changes, or better opportunities elsewhere. It also encourages schools to treat players better, knowing they can leave more easily. However, critics argue that it can hurt team stability and loyalty, with constant roster changes making it harder to build long-term team chemistry. While it promotes fairness and freedom, it also creates a more chaotic and competitive environment in college sports.</td>

         <td>Conference realignment is financially straining some schools by forcing them to spend more on travel, facilities, and competitiveness to keep up with their new conference peers. When schools move to larger or more geographically spread-out conferences, they often face increased travel costs for all sports, not just football. To remain competitive, they may also need to upgrade stadiums, training facilities, and coaching staffs, which can stretch already tight athletic budgets. Smaller programs especially struggle with these new demands, and if they don’t see a big increase in revenue from TV deals or sponsorships, the financial burden can outweigh the benefits of moving to a higher-profile conference.</td>

         <td><h3>How much does it cost to run a college football program?</h3></td>
         <td>Running a college football program can be extremely expensive, with costs varying widely depending on the size and competitiveness of the school. At major Division I programs, annual expenses can exceed $30 million, covering coaching salaries, scholarships, travel, equipment, recruiting, and facility maintenance. Top-tier programs may spend even more, especially with investments in state-of-the-art stadiums and support staff. Smaller programs still face significant costs, often ranging from $5 million to $15 million per year. While some schools generate enough revenue through ticket sales, TV deals, and donations to offset these costs, many others operate at a loss and rely on university funds or student fees to stay afloat.</td>

       <tr>
         <td><h3>Can schools profit through better NIL marketing and branding?</h3></td>
         <td>Yes, schools can profit indirectly through better NIL marketing and branding by attracting top athletes, increasing fan engagement, and boosting overall program visibility. While schools themselves can't directly pay athletes for NIL deals, they can create strong platforms and support systems—like media training, brand partnerships, and NIL collectives—that make their programs more appealing to recruits. As a result, better athletes lead to more wins, which can drive up ticket sales, merchandise revenue, alumni donations, and media attention. A well-branded program becomes a more valuable asset, and the overall success can lead to long-term financial growth for the athletic department and the university.</td>
